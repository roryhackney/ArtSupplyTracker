# ArtSupplyTracker
This was an initial attempt at my ongoing project to track and manage art supply collections.
I implemented it using Java Swing in order to manage the GUI in a desktop application, using inheritance to model different kinds of art supplies. On launch, the user can set their chosen name, and use the predefined random names, edit, or remove them.

After learning more about web development and app development using React and React native, I decided to move away from this implementation because I wanted to be able to use the application on the go, on the web or on mobile. I'm leaving this version up in case anyone is interested in seeing my previous concepts, my work writing desktop app GUIs with Java, or other parts of the project.
